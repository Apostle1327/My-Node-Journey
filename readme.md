# ⚡️ Welcome to My Node.js Adventure! 🚀

Hey there! I’m Neville, and I’m diving headfirst into the back-end world with Node.js. From handling asynchronous workflows to building powerful APIs, I’m excited to build, break, and rebuild on this thrilling journey.

## Learning Goals 🎯

In this new chapter of my dev story, I’m aiming to:

- **Grasp Node.js fundamentals:** Understand the event loop, the runtime environment, and how Node.js handles I/O under the hood.

- **Master asynchronous patterns:** Callbacks, promises, async/await—and learn when and how to use each effectively.

- **Build scalable APIs with Express:** Design RESTful endpoints, handle middleware, and implement error handling.

- **Work with databases:** Connect Node.js to MongoDB (and maybe PostgreSQL!), perform CRUD operations, and model schemas.

- **Automate workflows:** Use npm scripts, nodemon, and tooling to speed up development and testing.

- **Deploy real-world back-end apps:** From local dev to cloud deployment (Heroku, Vercel, or AWS), get my services live and running.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine.
- Express.js: Minimal and flexible web framework for Node.
- npm / Yarn: Package management and script runners.
- MongoDB / Mongoose: NoSQL database and elegant object modeling.
- TypeScript (TBD): Static typing for safer, more maintainable code.
- REST & JSON: Core principles for API design and data exchange.
- Postman / Insomnia: Tools for API testing and documentation.
